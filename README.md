# Let-s-Go

a) What are packages in your implementation? What data structure do you use to transmit data and meta-data?

b) Does your implementation use threads or processes? Why is it not realistic to use threads?

c) In case the network changes the order in which messages are delivered, how would you handle message re-ordering?

d) In case messages can be delayed or lost, how does your implementation handle message loss?


e) Why is the 3-way handshake important?
The three-way handshake is used to establish a reliable connection between a client and a server. It ensures that both sides of the connection has synced up properly and can send data to the eachother.
